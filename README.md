# pneumonia-classification
Evaluating various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for classifying pneumonia through the analysis of X-ray images.
This project aims to examine different pre-trained CNN models like VGG-16, ResNet50, and GoogLeNet. Additionally, assess strategies to handle class imbalance, making sure to create a reliable, robust, and accurate pneumonia detection system
